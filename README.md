# Belly_button_Challenge

The purpose of this project is to build an interactive dashboard to explore the Belly Button Biodiversity datasetLinks to an external site., which catalogs the microbes that colonize human navels.

The dataset reveals that a small handful of microbial species (also called operational taxonomic units, or OTUs, in the study) were present in more than 70% of people, while the rest were relatively rare.

Instructions
The following tasks were completed:

> Use the D3 library to read in samples.json from the URL https://2u-data-curriculum-team.s3.amazonaws.com/dataviz-classroom/v1.1/14-Interactive-Web-Visualizations/02-Homework/samples.json.

> Create a horizontal bar chart with a dropdown menu to display the top 10 OTUs found in that individual.

> Create a bubble chart that displays each sample.
